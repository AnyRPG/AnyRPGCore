SMALL ASSETS
--------------
Third party assets that are small enough to not materially affect the size of the export are included in their entirety in the Examples/ThirdPartyContent or Engine/ThirdPartyContent folders.
These assets are contained in their own subfolders that each have a file named AnyRPGThirdPartyAttribution.txt which contains links to the licenses and original download location.

LARGE ASSETS
--------------
Third party assets that are extremely large, where only small parts of the content were used, are located in the Content/ThirdPartyContent folder.
To ensure that the license files are not missed in the export, licenses have been moved/copied/created under the Engine/ThirdPartyContent/Licenses folder.
