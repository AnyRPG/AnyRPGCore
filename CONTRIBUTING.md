## How to Contribute to AnyRPG

### Community Guidelines

AnyRPG is an open source project run by volunteers who are not paid for their time.  Please be respectful of all project contributors and administrators and always follow the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/AnyRPG/AnyRPGCore/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Ways To Contribute

#### Contributing Art

The biggest need the AnyRPG project has is great art (2d and 3d).  If you are a 2d artist, 3d modeller, or animator, there are many options for you.

An up to date list can be found on the official [AnyRPG Discord](https://discord.gg/A6vx3QZjYQ).

#### Contributing Code

The AnyRPG Feature request backlog is available on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/dM5rhfEw/feature-requests).

If you see anything that you think you could implement, first check on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jajmEWcSbe) to ensure no one else is already working it.

#### Reporting Bugs

If you think you found a bug, the best course of action is to check the support channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/QquyhkZcF2) to ensure it is actually a bug, and not a workflow issue.

Once you are sure it is a real bug, please file a new [github issue](https://github.com/AnyRPG/AnyRPGCore/issues).

To ensure the bug report is actionable, the following should be included:
* A screenshot of any Unity console log errors with the full stack trace visible
* Every step you took to make the error happen.  This means **every** mouse click, keystroke, field edit, etc.  A person with no knowledge of the project should be able to read the steps and perform the same mouse clicks and key strokes to reproduce the issue.

#### Suggesting Features

To keep the github issues restricted to bugs, and prevent it from becoming unmanageably large, feature requests are tracked on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/dM5rhfEw/feature-requests).

To file feature requests on Trello, you will need to create a free Trello account, and then request access to the AnyRPG Trello boards by providing your trello username on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jajmEWcSbe).

### Making a Github Pull Request

If you are contributing code, please do so by making a github pull request.  You will need to fork the master branch of the [AnyRPGCore](https://github.com/AnyRPG/AnyRPGCore) repository, and complete any work in a feature branch.

When the feature (or bug fix) is complete, you can file a pull request to have the feature merged.

### Questions ?

If you are unsure of anything, the best course of action is to ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jajmEWcSbe).  The discord server has specific channels dedicated to support, contribution, learning, announcements, and links that you won't find on any other AnyRPG media.
