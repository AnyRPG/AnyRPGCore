# AnyRPG

## Introduction

This project contains the code for the AnyRPG Engine.

AnyRPG is a Role Playing Game engine written in C# for Unity.

It is a 100% free and open source project with the goal of enabling content creators to rapidly create unique and engaging short stories, scenarios, adventures, and even full games.

It accomplishes this by providing a platform with the most common Role Playing Game functionality out of the box so that content creators only need to provide visual assets and story content.
